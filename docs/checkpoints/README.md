# Checkpoints Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for each implementation checkpoint.

## Purpose

As you work through the Implementation Plan, create a markdown file here for each checkpoint documenting:
- Progress and decisions made
- Issues encountered and solutions
- Test results
- Time spent
- Key learnings

## Naming Convention

Files should be named: `X.Y-checkpoint-name.md`

Examples:
- `0.1-supabase-setup.md`
- `1.2-video-endpoints.md`
- `4.4-full-training-pipeline.md`

## Template

Use the template provided in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for each checkpoint file.

## Status Tracking

Update the status table in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as you complete each checkpoint.

**Legend:**
- ⏳ Pending
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Passed
- ⚠️ Passed with Issues
- ❌ Failed
- 🔁 Needs Retry

**These documents are your development journal. Be thorough!**
